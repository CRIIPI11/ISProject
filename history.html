        <h1>About The Creator</h1>
        <p>
          Since the eraly years, our creator started developing a passion for visual arts.
          During the early school years Eric started deleping a love for animated visual.
          Not much long, this love later made Eric start creating his own work such as 
          drawings and ideas of even making a movie one day. As the years passed, Eric 
          started working more making videos for local projects even being asked to produce
          educational videos for the school at his hometown. Improving his skills Eric later
          started working on bigger projects for more artists and companies until making what 
          today is The Prime Prodigy Company. However, Eric doesn't plan to stop here as his future
          plans include making movies of his own and also making a reality all his child characters.
